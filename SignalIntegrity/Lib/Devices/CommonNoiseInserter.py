def CommNoiseInserter():

    Common-mode noise inserter.
    @return the s-parameter matrix of a common-mode noise inserter.
    @remark
    Six-port device with ports:
    - 1, 2 : left differential pair
    - 3, 4 : right differential pair
    - 5, 6 : common-mode noise ports (noise source connects between 5 and 6)

    The device passes the differential signal from ports 1-2 through to
    ports 3-4 and simultaneously injects the common-mode noise from
    ports 5-6 into the output.

    It is formed by placing two voltage mixed-mode converters back-to-back,
    connecting the differential-mode ports together.  The statistical noise
    source is then connected between the common-mode ports, having the final
    effect of adding the noise to the common-mode signal.
